# So... what?

This project is just a small piece of code to track the bus while we are having breakfast.

I'd love to use jsonproxy.appspot.com, but it has a defect and the owner is not maintaining the project anymore, so I clone, patch and upload the project to ohmyjson.appspot.com.

Fork and configure yours 

(more instructions coming soon)
